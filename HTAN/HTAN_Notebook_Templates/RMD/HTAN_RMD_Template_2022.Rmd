# 1. Introduction & Overview 

[HTAN](https://humantumoratlas.org/) is a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded Cancer Moonshot<sup>SM</sup> initiative to construct 3-dimensional atlases of the dynamic cellular, morphological, and molecular features of human cancers as they evolve from precancerous lesions to advanced disease. [Cell April 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420303469) 

This notebook shows one example of how data can be accessed and analyzed using R programming software.

### 1.1 Goal
### 1.2 Inputs, Outputs, & Data (if applicable)
### 1.3 Notes (if applicable) 

# 2. Environment & Library Setup
```{r}
#List your additional libraries here
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressMessages(library(bigrquery))
suppressMessages(library(knitr))
```

# 3. Google Authentication

Running the BigQuery cells in this notebook requires a Google Cloud Project, instructions for creating a project can be found in the [Google Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#console). The instance needs to be authorized to bill the project for queries. For more information on getting started in the cloud see [Quick Start Guide to ISB-CGC](https://nbviewer.org/github/isb-cgc/Community-Notebooks/blob/master/Notebooks/Quick_Start_Guide_to_ISB_CGC.ipynb) and alternative authentication methods can be found in the [Google Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#console).

```{r eval = FALSE}
billing <- 'my-project' # Insert your project ID in the ''
if (billing == 'my-projectr') {
  print('Please update the project number with your Google Cloud Project')
}
