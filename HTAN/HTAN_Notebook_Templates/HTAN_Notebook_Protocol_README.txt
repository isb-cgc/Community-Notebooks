#TEMPLATE USE
To use the template, populate the code cells or chunks with your own analysis.
Examples of template use can be found in the Template_Use_Examples repository.
Figures should be centered and tables should be consistent across notebooks.

File naming for notebooks should adhere to the following format:
HTAN_[ANALYSIS NAME]_EXAMPLE_[PART or VERSION (if applicable)]_[YEAR]


#NOTES FOR AUTHORS
Eventually, the authentication will need to be changed after migration.
According to Vestienn: Make sure to point to staging tables.
A landing page for the notebooks is TBD.
