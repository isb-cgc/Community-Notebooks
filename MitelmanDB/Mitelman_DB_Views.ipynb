        "In previous notebooks we demonstrated how to find information in the Mitelman Database BigQuery tables by using SQL and joins. These queries give us the power to gather information from complex databases. One extension of this abilty is to utilize views in BigQuery. A view is a virtual table of data that is generated from a user-defined SQL query. This gives you the option to store a complex query and access the result of that query as if it were its own unique data table.\n",
