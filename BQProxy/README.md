A service that allows ISB-CGC users to run the bigquery statements in the COLLAB notebooks without using a billable account. They do this by running the Notebooks in a 'demo mode' in which the normal BigQuery endpoint is replaced by an endpoint for this service. This service does not provide fill access to bigquery, only the queries given in collab_queries.py can be run. See "How_to_make_a_heatmap_using_BigQuery.ipynb" for a demonstration
