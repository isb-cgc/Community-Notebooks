You can also import your data, analyze it side by side with the datasets, and share your data when you see fit. The ISB-CGC hosts carefully curated high-level clinical, biospecimen, and molecular datasets and tables in Google BigQuery, including data from programs such as [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga), [Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET)](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target), and [Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC)](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac). For more information can be found at our [Programs and Data Sets page](https://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/Hosted-Data.html). This data can be explored via python, [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and/or our [BigQuery Table Search tool](https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/bq_meta_search/)."
