Normal human cells are diploid, meaning they contain two sets of chromosomes. However, because cancer cells rapidly divide and often have errors in cell cycle regulation that have allowed them to become tumorous, cancer cells can be *aneuploid*, meaning they contain more or less than two sets of chromosomes. Aneuploid cancer cells can be more aggressive than diploid cancer cells, so knowing a tumor sample's average ploidy -- an average of the ploidies of all of the cancer cells in the sample -- can be clinically useful for determining the nature of a tumor, the patient's prognosis, and treatment plans. \n",

        "Here, we can see that the data is really much more modal than we thought. A significant portion of samples do indeed have average ploidies at or around 2.0. We also get a better idea of the true shape of the distribution, and we see that there is perhaps a second, smaller mode at 3.0. This might indicate that in aneuploid tumors, there is a slight tendency to retain the ploidy as tumor cells proliferate, since an individual cell's ploidy is usually a whole number set of chromosomes and the next aneuploidy greater than 2 is 3. If one of the original tumor cells was triploid, then the daughter tumor cells may carry the triploidy throughout the growth of the tumor.\n",
