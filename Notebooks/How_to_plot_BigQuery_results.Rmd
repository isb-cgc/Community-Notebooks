#How to visualize results from BigQuery

In this example, we'll perform a few easy queries, and use the ggplot library to visualize the results.

We will use theh bigrquery package to execute our SQL:  https://github.com/r-dbi/bigrquery

It is expected that you're running the notebook in an interactive mode, 
where you have access to a web browser for authorization with Google.

Library documentation: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/

There's many tidyverse tutorials. For example, http://www.storybench.org/getting-started-with-tidyverse-in-r/


```{r}
#Function to check whether package is installed
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9341635/check-for-installed-packages-before-running-install-packages
is.installed <- function(mypkg){
    is.element(mypkg, installed.packages()[,1])
} 
  
if (!is.installed("bigrquery")){
    install.packages("bigrquery")
}

if (!is.installed("ggplot2")){
    install.packages("ggplot2")
}


if (!is.installed("dbplyr")){
  install.packages("dbplyr")
}

if (!is.installed("dplyr")){
  install.packages(dplyr)
}

if (!is.installed("dbplyr")){
  install.packages(DBI)
}

```

Getting setup

```{r}
library(bigrquery)
library(ggplot2)
billing <- 'your_project_number' ### Replace with your project ID!! ### 
if (billing == 'your_project_number') {
  print('Please update the project number with your Google Cloud Project')
}
```

## Making barplots

The first time you run bq_project_query, you will be asked if you want to authorize locally
in the R session.  By selecting 'yes', a browser tab will open allowing google auth.

```{r}
# We define queries as strings #
sql = "
SELECT
   icd_10,
   COUNT(*) as Count
FROM
   `isb-cgc.TCGA_bioclin_v0.Clinical`
GROUP BY
   1  -- this is the same as 'group by icd_10'
ORDER BY
   Count
"

tb <- bq_project_query(billing, sql)
df <- bq_table_download(tb, max_results = 200)

df[1:5,]
```

Now we can make a bar plot with ggplot2.

```{r}

df2 <- df[df$Count > 200,]
g <- ggplot(data=df2, aes(x=icd_10, y=Count))
g + geom_bar(stat="identity")


```

## Making scatter plots

```{r}

sql = "
SELECT
   avg_percent_neutrophil_infiltration,
   avg_percent_lymphocyte_infiltration
FROM
   `isb-cgc.TCGA_bioclin_v0.Biospecimen`
GROUP BY
   1,2
"

tb3 <- bq_project_query(billing, sql)
df3 <- bq_table_download(tb3, max_results = 200)

df3[1:5,]

```

And now we make plot those results.

Note: It is always best practice to summarize within BigQuery, 
and plot *summarized* results.

```{r}

g <- ggplot(data=df3, aes(x=avg_percent_lymphocyte_infiltration, y=avg_percent_neutrophil_infiltration))
g + geom_point()

```


## Using dplyr

You can use dplyr to create SQL!
We'll recreate the first query.

```{r}

sql = "
SELECT
   icd_10,
   COUNT(*) as Count
FROM
   `isb-cgc.TCGA_bioclin_v0.Clinical`
GROUP BY
   1  -- this is the same as 'group by icd_10'
ORDER BY
   Count
"

library(dplyr)
library(DBI)

con <- dbConnect(
  bigrquery::bigquery(),
  project = "isb-cgc",
  dataset = "TCGA_bioclin_v0",
  billing = billing
)
con

tcga_clinical <- tbl(con, "Clinical")

res4 <- tcga_clinical %>% select(icd_10) %>% group_by(icd_10) %>% tally()

head(res4)
```


And now we can plot the results!

```{r}

df3 <- res4 %>% filter(n > 200)
g <- ggplot(data=df3, aes(x=icd_10, y=n))
g + geom_bar(stat="identity")

```
