In this notebook, we will cover how to do a one-way ANOVA test in BigQuery. This statistical test can be used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two or more independent groups. Although in this example, I’m only looking at two groups, it would not be difficult to extend this to any number of groups, assuming there is a reasonable number of samples within each group.

Consider the model y<sub>ij</sub> = m + a<sub>i</sub> + e<sub>ij</sub>, where y<sub>ij</sub> is a continuous variable over samples j, in groups i, and a<sub>i</sub> is a constant for each group i, and e<sub>ij</sub> is a gaussian error term with mean 0.

Using this model, we are describing the data as being sampled from groups, with each group having a mean value equal to m + a<sub>i</sub>. The null hypothesis is that each of the group means is the same (ie that the ai terms are zero), while the alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the ai terms is not zero.

We use the F-test to compare these two hypotheses. To compute the test statistic, we compute the within-group variation and the between-group variation. Recall that sample variance is defined as the sum of squared differences between observations and the mean, divided by the number of samples (normalized).

First, we will need to import the required libraries and create a client variable. For more information see ['Quick Start Guide to ISB-CGC'](https://github.com/isb-cgc/Community-Notebooks/blob/master/Notebooks/Quick_Start_Guide_for_ISB-CGC.md) and alternative authentication methods can be found [here](https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/core/auth.html).

```{r Load Libraries}
library(bigrquery)
library(dplyr)
```

Then let us set up the billing variables we will be using in this notebook:
```{r Set Up Variables}
billing <- 'your_project_number' # Insert your project ID in the ''
if (billing == 'your_project_number') {
  print('Please update the project number with your Google Cloud Project')
}
```

Let’s look at the query:
```{r ANOVA Query}

  --
  -- To get the between-group variance

```{r Run the ANOVA Query}
# To see the R console output with query processing information, turn queit to FALSE

OK, so let’s check our work. Using the BRCA cohort and TP53 as our gene, we have 375 samples with a variant in this gene. We’re going to look at whether the type of variant is related to the gene expression we observe. If we just pull down the data using the ‘cohort’ subtable (as above), we can get a small data frame, which let’s us do the standard F stat table in R.

```{r Create dat Query}
dat_query = "

```{r Run dat Query}

```{r View the mean and sd per group}
