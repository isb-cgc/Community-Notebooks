        "The data that GDC provides through their API is naturally nested. A given patient may, for instance, have multiple diagnoses at the same time. Frequently, they may receive multiple treatments to combat their cancer or have multiple follow up visits to monitor their cancer's progression. The data generated in these examples means that there will be a variable number of records of each type for a given research subject. Traditionally, ISB-CGC has stored these supplemental records in a separate table. However, they are extracted from GDC in the form of a nested JSON object.\n",
        "\n",
        "BigQuery supports nested columns, and there are advantages to storing the data in this format. Since all of the data is stored in one table, you don't have to locate and join the supplemental tables in order to access data. Instead, you can use UNNEST clauses to flatten the data as needed for your research. This guide provides an introduction to [using UNNEST in your SQL queries](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/arrays#querying_nested_arrays)."
