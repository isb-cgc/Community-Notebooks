    "Notes:   This notebook was adapted from work by Sheila Reynolds, 'How to Create TCGA Cohorts part 1' https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python/blob/master/notebooks/Creating%20TCGA%20cohorts%20--%20part%201.ipynb.\n",

    "This notebook will show you how to create a TCGA cohort using the publicly available TCGA BigQuery tables that the [ISB-CGC](http://isb-cgc.org) project has produced based on the open-access [TCGA](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) data available at the [Data Portal](https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/).  You will need to have access to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project in order to use BigQuery.  If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a [free-trial](https://cloud.google.com/free-trial/). You can also explore the available tables and data sets before commiting to creating a GCP project though the [ISB-CGC BigQuery Table Searcher](isb-cgc.appspot.com/bq_meta_search/).\n",

    "In this tutorial, we are going to look at a few different ways that we can use the information in these tables to create cohorts.  Now, you maybe asking what we mean by \"cohort\" and why you might be interested in *creating* one, or maybe what it even means to \"create\" a cohort.  The TCGA dataset includes clinical, biospecimen, and molecular data from over 10,000 cancer patients who agreed to be a part of this landmark research project to build [The Cancer Genome Atlas](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/).  This large dataset was originally organized and studied according to [cancer type](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/cancersselected) but now that this multi-year project is nearing completion, with over 30 types of cancer and over 10,000 tumors analyzed, **you** have the opportunity to look at this dataset from whichever angle most interests you.  Maybe you are particularly interested in early-onset cancers, or gastro-intestinal cancers, or a specific type of genetic mutation.  This is where the idea of a \"cohort\" comes in.  The original TCGA \"cohorts\" were based on cancer type (aka \"study\"), but now you can define a cohort based on virtually any clinical or molecular feature by querying these BigQuery tables.  A cohort is simply a list of samples, using the [TCGA barcode](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Encyclopedia/pages/TCGA_Barcode/) system.  Once you have created a cohort you can use it in any number of ways: you could further explore the data available for one cohort, or compare one cohort to another, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this tutorial, we will create several different cohorts based on different motivating research questions.  We hope that these examples will provide you with a starting point from which you can build, to answer your own research questions."

    "Let's start by looking at the clinical data table.  The TCGA dataset contains a few very basic clinical data elements for almost all patients, and contains additional information for some tumor types only.  For example smoking history information is generally available only for lung cancer patients, and BMI (body mass index) is only available for tumor types where that is a known significant risk factor.  Let's take a look at the clinical data table and see how many different pieces of information are available to us:"
